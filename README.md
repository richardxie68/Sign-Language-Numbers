# Sign-Language-Numbers
Applied logistical regression to implement artificial neural network in deep learning to predict numbers from sign language.

In this project, I applied advanced deep learning concepts to predict numbers. I initially began exploring the data in order to prepare the images in the image array to be input. Afterwards, in order to implement logistic regression, I chose arbitrary values as my initial parameters and altered them as needed. Next, I included forward propagation by utilizing a Sigmod function, loss function, and cost function. In order to implement an optimization algorithm with gradient descent, I used backward propagation and continued to update the parameters until I got my desired outcome. Afterwards, more testing was performed on my optimal model in order to predict correct numbers from given sign language images.

If this model will be continually developed in the future, it could be great for computers to automatically predict numbers for multi-use purposes.

## This project contains two files:
NumPredict.ipynb: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
x.npy: The project dataset. Unfortunately, this dataset is too big and can't be uploaded onto Git
y.npy: The project dataset part two.

## Install
Depending on the enviroment, you may need to install the following packages in python in order to successfully run this project:

Python
